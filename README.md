A well-documented case of seismic activity potentially induced by wastewater injection was an intense sequence of earthquake swarms that occurred near the towns of Guy and Greenbrier, Arkansas (Fig. 1), between August 2010 and June 2011 (Horton, 2012). The earthquakes started within a few weeks after beginning of injection at nearby wells (less than 6 km away), and after a period of intense activity, gradually stopped within a three-month period following injection termination.

Several earthquake catalogs exist for this sequence based on different detection methods: Horton (2012) (ANSS) and  Ogwari et al. (2016) based on STA/LTA, Huang and Beroza, (2015) based on templet matching, Yoon et al., (2017) based on FAST, and Mousavi et al (2018) based on deep learning. August 2010 is the overlapping time period in these catalogs, hence we made a unified catalog for this period combining information of all the above catalogs containing 3788 events. Most of these events are microearthquakes with local magnitudes ranging from -1.3 to 0.5 associated with hydraulic fracturing or wastewater injection. Events are located within a 2 km area at 2 to 4 km depths (Figure 2).
